## Usage

1. Navigate to a supported social media platform (LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter/X, ...)
2. Click the TapReply extension icon in the Chrome extensions dropdown (pin it for ease of use)
3. Select your preferred tone (supportive, analytical, or witty)
4. Click "Generate Reply" to create a context-aware reply to the current social media post
5. Copy and paste the generated reply, editing as you wish before sending it


## Configuration

This can be done via the extension's options page, found through the chrome browser or by clicking the gear icon in the footer of the extension's popup. The following fields can be configured there:

- **API Provider**: Choose between OpenAI and Google Gemini
- **API Key**: Set your preferred LLM API key
- **Reply Length**: Short, medium, or long replies
- **Default Tone**: Set your preferred default tone


## Architecture

The extension follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Background Script** (`background.js`): Service worker handling LLM API calls and other operations in the background
- **Content Scripts** (`scripts/`): Injected into web pages to extract post content and metadata using platform-specific adapters
- **Popup Interface** (`popup/`): User interface for tone selection and reply generation
- **Options Page** (`options/`): Configuration interface for API settings and preferences
- **Manifest** (`manifest.json`): Extension configuration and permissions declaration


## Adding New Platforms

The extension is designed to be easily extensible. The general idea is that a new platform adapter class (responsible for platform-specific post content extraction) is created and added to the factory function, making it automatically used when you navigate to that platform's website. See [PLATFORM_EXTENSION_GUIDE.md](PLATFORM_EXTENSION_GUIDE.md) for more detailed instructions on adding support for new social media platforms.
